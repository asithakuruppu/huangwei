        speaker: "Guest",

He emphasized that design isn't about decoration, but about finding the essential form of communication. His famous 'dot, line, and plane' exercises helped students understand the fundamental elements of visual composition.",

        speaker: "Host",

      },
      {
        speaker: "Guest",
        text: "Absolutely. Hofmann believed that contrast was the driving force of good design. He wasn't just talking about black and base-light, but about the interplay between forms, sizes, and textures. His posters for the Basel Theater are perfect examples – they achieve maximum impact with minimal elements.",

        speaker: "Guest",
        text: "What struck me was how hands-on and experimental his teaching method was. Students weren't just learning rules; they were discovering principles through practical work. His famous exercises, like creating compositions using only black paper and scissors, forced students to think deeply about form and space.",

        text: "It's everywhere, really. The emphasis on grid systems, the careful consideration of typography and space, the focus on clear visual hierarchy – these are all Hofmann principles that have become fundamental to UI/UX design. Even minimalist web design owes a debt to his teachings.",

        speaker: "Guest",
        text: "That's an interesting question. I think he would appreciate how his fundamental principles have adapted to new mediums. He always said that good design transcends its medium. However, he might challenge us to be more rigorous in our thinking and less reliant on digital shortcuts.",
